# Random Music Scripts

This is a repo that contains all the random little scripts I write to automate things related to music

## Introduction

This repo contains the following scripts

<ins>**Copy over MIDI Files**</ins>

This script copies all MIDI files and their directory structures over to a new folder.

This is great for having all MIDI files gathered into one place while still keeping which Sample Pack they are from

<ins>**Remove Dots**</ins>

This script removes all dots and other weird characters from filenames and folders in a particular directory.

This was needed because certain files and folders from MSXII Audio Sample Packs had special characters that caused issues in Maschine 2

## Installation

Just run npm install in a particular project directory to install everything needed for that script

```bash
npm install
```
